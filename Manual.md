#**High Flow Float Valve**

## Manual
###Introduction
The High Flow Float Valve will serve to control the flow rate of water into the distribution tank. To avoid the tank overflowing, the float valve will decrease the flow rate as the tank fills up. The float valve consists of a slider pipe, a tee connected to the distribution tank inlet pipe, a float on top of the slider pipe, and bushings inside the tee that the slider pipe will slide through. The slider pipe has an increasing number of holes from bottom to top. The water entering the distribution tank will go through the tee and through the hole in the slider pipe that are within the tee. The more holes exposed, the higher the flow rate. As the tank fills up, the float will cause the slider pipe to rise, which will decrease the number of holes exposed within the tee. When the tank is full, no holes will be exposed within the tee and the flow will stop.

####Procedure
The High Flow Float Valve team is planning to assemble a model float valve of smaller dimensions in order to test the functionality of it before switching to the larger, necessary size. The team started by cutting a piece of 1.5" pipe to 41cm using the table clamp and the reciprocating saw. The team then used the bandsaw and the angle alignment tool to produce two cuts in the top of the pipe to form a notch as shown below.  This notch will be used to secure the buoy to the pipe with a hose clamp later.

\
Next, the team cut each of the PVC bushings to 1" in height using the band saw.

The team then created a handmade sanding tool. This tool was made from an arbitrarily long 1" PVC pipe with a thick piece of sandpaper PVC-glued to around its circumference.

\
The team then used this tool, as well as a handheld file, to sand down the inside of the bushings so that the 1.5" pipe could slide easily through.

The team then used a template created from the Fusion design to accurately drill the holes in the slider pipe. The team printed the template and  punctured small holes through the hole indications. The team then laid this template around the slider pipe and drew a mark on the slider pipe through the small holes to indicate where to drill.

The team then cut holes according to this template using the drill press.
