## Manual
###Introduction
The high flow float valve will control the flow rate of water into the distribution tank. The distribution tank is the storage tank for clean water exiting the treatment plant before it is distributed to the community, and overflows when the tank is full. Overflow happens mainly during off-peak hours from midnight to dawn when demand is low. Avoiding overflow is desirable because the excess treated drinking water is wasted. To avoid the tank overflowing , the float valve will decrease the flow rate as the tank fills up.

The float valve consists of a slider pipe, a tee connected to the distribution tank inlet pipe, a float on top of the slider pipe, and bushings inside the tee that the slider pipe will slide through. The slider pipe has an increasing number of holes from bottom to top. The water entering the distribution tank will go through the tee and through the hole in the slider pipe that are within the tee. The more holes exposed, the higher the flow rate. As the tank fills up, the float will cause the slider pipe to rise, which will decrease the number of holes exposed within the tee. When the tank is full, no holes will be exposed within the tee and the flow will stop.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
In the first sectence, consider lower case "high flow float valve" as it is not a proper noun here. Also consider "The high flow float valve will control" rather than "serve to control." Also what is the "distribution tank," and when does it overflow? Distribution tank to me means the final tank after the full treatment train, but before going out to the community. Explanation in the final three sentences is very good. Not enough connection as to why is it bad is the distribution tank overflows.

###Design Details

Please include source (i.e. McMaster Carr) and the approximate unit price in the table. Consider adding a table of tools needed for fabrication as described in your procedure. (Include the sandpaper, saws, extra pvc for sanding tool etc.)

####Procedure
The High Flow Float Valve team is planning to assemble a model float valve of smaller dimensions in order to test the functionality of it before switching to the larger, necessary size. The team started by cutting a piece of 1.5" pipe to 41cm using the table clamp and the reciprocating saw. The team then used the bandsaw and the angle alignment tool to produce two cuts in the top of the pipe to form a notch as shown below.  This notch will be used to secure the buoy to the pipe with a hose clamp later.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Avoid "model float valve of smaller dimensions" because it is wordy. "small-scale float valve" works just as well. Even better would be to include what scale the model is. Same idea with the phrase "functionality of it", "the model's functionality" is more streamlined.

Will you also be constructing the full scale model? The sentence referring to "the larger, necessary size" is ambiguous.

Is 1.5" pvc pipe the conventional way to refer to pvc pipe of diameter 1.5"? If so keep it, if not make it reflect convention. (I don't know myself)

Why 41cm length? Where did you get this number from? Include relevant equuations. If no equations were used, say that that is an assumed value. If it is a value that Monroe gave you, ask him how he got it.

Is the "buoy" the float? Be consistent with the names you give to the different parts of your design.

Next, the team cut each of the PVC bushings to 1" in height using the band saw.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Consider overlaying your photos with arrows/labels. For example pointing out the bushings in the photo on the left below. (I am not very fabrication driven so I don't know what a bushing is, so incoming freshmen may not know as well. Remember that the audience here is a new member of AguaClara). Great visuals used.

\
The team then created a handmade sanding tool. This tool was made from an arbitrarily long 1" PVC pipe with a thick piece of sandpaper PVC-glued to around its circumference.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Reconsider "thick piece of sandpaper PVC-glued to around its circumfrence". Too many words and PVC-glued seems informal.
</div>

\
The team then used this tool, as well as a handheld file, to sand down the inside of the bushings so that the 1.5" pipe could slide easily through.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Why is it important that the pipe easily slide through? Is it important to minimize the sliding friction between the parts so that the float floats enough to allow the correct amount of flow? Keep connecting what you're doing to the why of what you're doing. What is driving the design of the float valve in terms of equations and assumptions, and fluids, etc.?

Great photos! This step by step is easy to follow and clear.

The team then used a template created from the Fusion design to accurately drill the holes in the slider pipe. The team printed the template and  punctured small holes through the hole indications. The team then laid this template around the slider pipe and drew a mark on the slider pipe through the small holes to indicate where to drill.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
BIG ONE: Where did the template made in Fusion come from? How did you determine the hole pattern? This is a key part of understanding this design. Include equations, development of design. What is that fusion template gets lost in the cloud and the next team has to recreate it?

The second and third sentences are confusing. It takes a few readings to understand that you are puncturing the paper. Make it a little more explicit.

Also does it matter where you lay the template on the slider? Align it from the bottom, the top?
</div>

The team then cut holes according to this template using the drill press.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
BIG ONE: How big are the holes supposed to be? And how did you get that value? Again root it in the theory and maths.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Sometimes there are spaces after the photos before the text and sometimes not. Chose one or the other.

For the next submission, add in a section about future/anticipated steps. This will give me an opportunity to read through and get a greater understanding. It also allows more of an opportunity to give you feedback on writing style and format.
