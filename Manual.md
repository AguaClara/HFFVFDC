Manual
The goal of this section is to provide all of the guidance that would be necessary for a future team to pick up your work where you left off. Please try to be thorough and put yourselves in the shoes of a newcomer to the project. Below are some recommended sections, but the manual will likely take a slightly different form for each team.

Fabrication Details
Include any information related to the fabrication of equipment, experimental apparatuses, or technologies. Include the purpose of each step and the fabrication methods used. Reference appropriate safety precautions.

Special Components
If your subteam uses a particular part that is unique and you could foresee a future subteam needing to order it or learn more about it, please include basic information like the vendor where it was purchased, catalog/item number, and a link to any documentation.

## Manual

###Introduction
The High Flow Float Valve will serve to control the flow rate of water into the distribution tank. To avoid the tank overflowing, the float valve will decrease the flow rate as the tank fills up. The float valve consists of a slider pipe, a tee connected to the distribution tank inlet pipe, a float on top of the slider pipe, and bushings inside the tee that the slider pipe will slide through. The slider pipe has an increasing number of holes from bottom to top. The water entering the distribution tank will go through the tee and through the hole in the slider pipe that are within the tee. The more holes exposed, the higher the flow rate. As the tank fills up, the float will cause the slider pipe to rise, which will decrease the number of holes exposed within the tee. When the tank is full, no holes will be exposed within the tee and the flow will stop.

####Procedure
The High Flow Float Valve team is planning to assemble a model float valve of smaller dimensions in order to test the functionality of it before switching to the larger, necessary size. The team started by cutting a piece of 1.5" pipe to 41cm using the table clamp and the reciprocating saw. The team then used the bandsaw and the angle alignment tool to produce two cuts in the top of the pipe to form a notch as shown below.  This notch will be used to secure the buoy to the pipe with a hose clamp later.

\
Next, the team cut each of the PVC bushings to 1" in height using the band saw.

\
The team then created a handmade sanding tool. This tool was made from an arbitrarily long 1" PVC pipe with a thick piece of sandpaper PVC-glued to around its circumference.

\
The team then used this tool, as well as a handheld file, to sand down the inside of the bushings so that the 1.5" pipe could slide easily through.

Experimental Checklist
Another potential section could include a list of things that you need to check before running an experiment.

ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example: \begin{itemize} \item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off. \end{itemize}

Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.

Python Code
Variables
$g$: gravity $\sigma$: dispersion $a$: amplitude $h$: water depth $H$: distance from wave crest to trough (2$a$) $T$: wave period $\lambda$: wavelength $k$: wavenumber $c_p$: celerity (wave phase speed) $P$: pressure $F$: force $u$, $w$: x-velocity, z-velocity components
